excerpt: The Content Workflow System to edit and publish tutorials at Programiz uses Google Docs and Python at the backend to convert Google Docs To HTML and vice versa.

As of May 2020, I have been working as a Python Developer and a Senior Content Editor at [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/) for the past 8 months.

At Programiz, one of our daily tasks is to create beginner-friendly programming tutorials that eventually reach out to millions of users all over the world. Behind the scenes, we are also constantly experimenting with different tools and techniques to furnish our products and enhance the user experience.

One such tool I recently developed for Programiz — called the Content Workflow System — allows the content writers to effectively write, edit, manage, review, and publish programming tutorials on the Programiz website.

Most of the tutorial articles that you see today on the Programiz website are derived from Google Docs!

With the help of this tool, the content writers can directly publish their writings from Google Docs to the website. Moreover, the pre-existing websites can also be converted back to Google Docs for editing.
