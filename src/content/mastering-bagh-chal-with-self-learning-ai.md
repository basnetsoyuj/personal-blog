People have long dreamed of creating machines that can think and decide for themselves. There have been countless Sci-Fi books and movies that exploit (and sometimes over hype) the term "Artificial Intelligence". This peculiar trait of the human mind — to imagine something well before it comes into existence — has itself led to many inventions and discoveries. Just a decade ago, the research on Artificial Intelligence was limited to only a few candidates pursuing higher degrees in Universities or big companies. The increase in computational power and data availability over the past few years, however, has made it possible for anyone with a decent computer to get started with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This blog discusses one such personal project that I started working on almost a year ago. The project tries to use state-of-the-art methods in the deep reinforcement learning paradigm to master the traditional Nepali board game of Bagh Chal through self-play.

### The Motivation Behind the Project
Back in the summer of 2017, I had a few months break before starting my junior year in high school. At that point, I was not new to programming but I barely had any idea about Artificial intelligence (AI). I wanted to understand how chess engines like Stockfish (not an AI engine) work, but soon found myself in AI territory once I heard about AlphaZero. That instantly got me into ML/AI and I spent almost two years starting from scratch and working on smaller projects.

Inspired by AlphaZero, I thought of making a chess engine but the complexity of the game and the amount of training it would require set me back even before I got started. During my senior year, I tried making a similar engine as a science fair project but for a much simpler game of Bagh Chal. Even then, I had underestimated the difficulty of the project and the time scramble led to the project failure without yielding any results. I stopped working on it for a while until I finished high school and gave it another shot.

Even though the agent is by no means "**_Alpha_**", the ultimate joy of being crushed by your own creation is second to none.

If you want to learn more about the project and play around with its code, you can find one early prototype of this project in the [GitHub AlphaBaghChal Repository](https://github.com/basnetsoyuj/AlphaBaghChal).
